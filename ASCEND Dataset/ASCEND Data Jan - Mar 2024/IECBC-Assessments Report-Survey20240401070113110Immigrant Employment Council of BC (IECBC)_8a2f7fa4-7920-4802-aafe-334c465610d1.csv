The weekly email reminders and notifications were also helpful. I would have been unable to complete it if I only had a one-off reminder. So, this is me saying I love the program and strategies put in place to help participants complete it.

I also noticed that when I am inactive on the website, I'm automatically logged out. I understand that it helps with security and since it's on a personal computer, logging in didn't take so much time. However, there was a 'keep me logged in' tab but it wasn't working. I believe if it works, it will help to keep those using their personal computers logged in. And people not working with their PC wouldn't bother to use the button.

Si vous avez apprécié le programme ASCEND, nous vous invitons à partager un commentaire que nous pourrions utiliser pour promouvoir le programme. Si vous nous autorisez à mentionner également votre prénom, merci de bien vouloir saisir ‘Y’ à la fin de votre commentaire.","Le programme ASCEND m'a permis de situer mes angles morts, de savoir transformer un problème en une victoire et d'utiliser mes ""soft skills"" de manière plus efficace. À présent, je comprends mieux les différents enjeux rencontrés dans ma carrière professionnelle, pourquoi mon CV ne se démarquait pas, et ce qui me faisait défaut lors des entrevues. 
Le programme m'a apporté plus que ce que je pouvais espérer. Je pense être maintenant, en mesure de trouver l'emploi qui me correspond le plus, en Colombie-Britannique.
Je remercie toute l'équipe ayant contribué à ce programme et particulièrement à l'agent de liaison en charge des ateliers.

It is written in a simple and understandable language.

I especially liked the videos (I was very impressed with the video on public speaking)
Also, videos with Nazir are very instructive. 
Thank you for the transcript. I took many phrases for communication from there.

The call recordings on various topics were super useful. It's good to understand now that it's worth discussing salary and other details during the process of signing the contract and not during the interview.

I recently completed the ASCEND course, and I must say it exceeded my expectations. The structured approach, guiding from job search to career development, is incredibly helpful. The content is presented in simple and understandable language, making it accessible to everyone.

The video content, especially those featuring Nazir, is a standout. The public speaking video left a lasting impression, and I appreciated having transcriptions available. I've incorporated many communication phrases from there into my repertoire.

The call recordings covering various topics were invaluable. Learning when and how to discuss salary and other details during the contract signing process was an eye-opener. I'm grateful for the insight. The mention of Friendship Toastmasters Club was a fantastic discovery; I've already located them on Google and plan to attend. Overall, ASCEND has been a game-changer in my career journey.

Firstly, having a more structured feedback mechanism would be beneficial. It could be in the form of surveys or regular check-ins to gather insights on what participants find most valuable and areas that could use improvement.

Additionally, incorporating more interactive workshops or case studies would be great. This hands-on approach could help us apply the concepts we've learned in practical scenarios, enhancing our skills and engagement.

I also think there could be more networking opportunities. Whether through organized events or connecting participants with industry professionals, this could provide valuable mentorship and potential career prospects.

Considering the ever-evolving job market, regular updates to the program content would keep it relevant. Having a resource library with additional materials for ongoing reference could be beneficial as well.

Customization options based on individual career goals would add a personalized touch. Each participant has unique needs, and tailoring content could make the program more relevant.

Lastly, a focus on diversity and inclusion within the content would be valuable. Navigating diverse professional environments is crucial, and addressing this aspect could benefit participants.
