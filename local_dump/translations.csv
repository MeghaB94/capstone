"I specifically liked that I was given sufficient time to complete the program knowing fully that one would also have other commitments. The weekly email reminders and notifications were also helpful. I would have been unable to complete it if I only had a one-off reminder. So, this is me saying I love the program and strategies put in place to help participants complete it.

I also noticed that when I am inactive on the website, I'm automatically logged out. I understand that it helps with security and since it's on a personal computer, logging in didn't take so much time. However, there was a 'keep me logged in' tab but it wasn't working. I believe if it works, it will help to keep those using their personal computers logged in. And people not working with their PC wouldn't bother to use the button.","I specifically liked that I was given sufficient time to complete the program knowing fully that one would also have other commitments.

"Overall, the course is very structured, going step by step from job search to career development. It is written in a simple and understandable language.

I especially liked the videos (I was very impressed with the video on public speaking)
Also, videos with Nazir are very instructive. 
Thank you for the transcript. I took many phrases for communication from there.

The call recordings on various topics were super useful. It's good to understand now that it's worth discussing salary and other details during the process of signing the contract and not during the interview. Also, thank you for the information about Friendship Toastmasters Club. I have already found them on Google and will definitely go there.","Overall, the course is very structured, going step by step from job search to career development.

"I've had a positive experience with ASCEND, and I believe a few enhancements could make it even more impactful for participants like me. Firstly, having a more structured feedback mechanism would be beneficial. It could be in the form of surveys or regular check-ins to gather insights on what participants find most valuable and areas that could use improvement.

Additionally, incorporating more interactive workshops or case studies would be great. This hands-on approach could help us apply the concepts we've learned in practical scenarios, enhancing our skills and engagement.

I also think there could be more networking opportunities. Whether through organized events or connecting participants with industry professionals, this could provide valuable mentorship and potential career prospects.

Considering the ever-evolving job market, regular updates to the program content would keep it relevant. Having a resource library with additional materials for ongoing reference could be beneficial as well.

Customization options based on individual career goals would add a personalized touch. Each participant has unique needs, and tailoring content could make the program more relevant.

Lastly, a focus on diversity and inclusion within the content would be valuable. Navigating diverse professional environments is crucial, and addressing this aspect could benefit participants.

"I am incredibly grateful for the invaluable experience I gained from participating in the ASCEND program. Having lived in Canada for the past two years, I thought I had a good understanding of the employment landscape, but ASCEND opened my eyes to the intricacies of navigating the Canadian professional environment.
One of the most significant takeaways for me was the emphasis on networking. The program provided practical insights and strategies on how to build meaningful connections in the Canadian business world. 
ASCEND also delved into the importance of understanding and adapting to organizational culture. This knowledge has been instrumental in helping me understand seamlessly into different work environments, which will contribute to my success in the Canadian job market.
Moreover, the program's focus on effective communication skills has been transformative. I learned how to provide constructive feedback without causing offense, a skill that has improved my relationships both personally and professionally. The emphasis on articulating my career achievements in a way that aligns with my career goals was particularly enlightening, giving me the tools to showcase my accomplishments strategically.
In essence, ASCEND has not only broadened my understanding of the Canadian employment landscape but has equipped me with practical skills that have significantly accelerated my career development. I highly recommend ASCEND to anyone looking to not only survive but thrive in the Canadian professional world.","I am incredibly grateful for the invaluable experience I gained from participating in the ASCEND program.

"I liked all the Modules in ASCEND. Starting from how to prepare a resume, various job portals to post and the steps to follow to prepare for an interview and onboarding process and learning how to negotiate the salary and importantly learning about the organizations culture to contribute better for achieving the goals, about the time management, and last but not least how to make career progression. All of these have helped me a lot in understanding the process involved in getting a job and contributing for the success of the organization.","I liked all the Modules in ASCEND.
